    Hello everyone. Today I'm going to be talking about UVSOps, which stands for Ultraviolet Spectrometer Operations. I'll get to what each of the words mean in a bit, but first, a bit of intro of the mission, me and my team, and what we needed to build a CakePHP application for. 
v
Europa Clipper is a roughly $5B NASA spacecraft launching this October and on it is an instrument made by the organization I work for in San Antonio, TX, USA. 
>
Who am I? 
If you were at CakeFest last year, you've seen this slide before.
- That one was on distributed Docker/Kubernetes environments and a lot more technical.  
I'm a Research Computer Scientist at Southwest Research Institute in SATX. We're a non-profit dedicated to R&D from Deep Sea to Deep Space. This includes Oil Pipeline crush testing, creating fire resistant materials, EV battery crush testing, the cybersecurity on that same vehicle, fire resistant materials, and the department I'm in - space research. 
I have a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from The University of Texas which makes sense because I like a whole gamut of Engineering fields, having previously done work in robotics and cybersecurity prior to space science. 
But that doesn't mean I'm new to PHP and webdev! 
When I was in 5th grade or so, my sister and I got a Nintendo DSi. While it was neat, we didn't have many games for it, but it could browse the internet. And on there, I found out that the browser could run JavaScript. In that, I also found that there was a whole Nintendo DSi Community building social networking sites for the console and decided to do the same. 
There's a whole number of things I enjoy including cars, reading, tropical weather, and building things. 
>
As for my group, we're a small group of 3. The others on my team have been using CakePHP 1.x but I joined 3.52yrs ago, to be exact. 
[Rest of slide] 
...space science which goes back decades

EUROPA CLIPPER
EC is a spacecraft to research Jupiter's icy moon, Europa. It has a sister spacecraft JUICE (JUpiter Icy Moons Explorer) which is going to another of Jupiter's moons called Ganymede. 
JUICE launched Feb 2023, and EC's launch window begins Oct 10th, 2024.
After a few gravity assists, they should both arrive around Jupiter in 2030.  

You may ask... Why? 

Things invented due to space science: laptops, GPS, water filters, smoke detectors, solar panels, prosthetics 

Well Europa appears to have twice as much water as earth [image - https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120524.html] under a sheet of ice. Additionally, it has a bit of heat from tidal flexing of the ice due to Jupiter's gravity, which if we're going to find what we define as "life", it would be here. Additionally, there are water plumes that are ejected and so the spacecraft may even fly through one. 

[go to page]
What you're looking at is a model of the spacecraft which is 16 ft (or 5 m) tall and ~100 ft wide (30.5 m) when deployed. 
UVS observes ultraviolet light within the spectral range of 55 nm to 210 nm.
Why? Think of the red-green glasses for 3D movies. By looking at the same thing in different parts of the EM spectrum, we see different things which gives us more info on what we're looking at. 
MASPEX is a mass spectrometer for studying chemical compounds. I don't work on that instrument, but I'm happy to talk about it later if anyone wants to ask me.
>
CakePHP. Would be awkward if it wasn't. Going from 4 --/>5. Had a few issues with data quantities. 
Obviously that's built on PHP. 
Rest of these are JS, but we have a lott of custom JS for this on top of it. 
jQuery will probably change to HTMX in the future.

<!--14:45--15:30-->
<!--
In this talk, we'll demonstrate our Space Mission Planning tool webapp designed for the
Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS) instrument on the Europa Clipper spacecraft, which is launching this October 10th!
This webapp enables scientists to plan flybys and decide whether the instrument should scan, stare, or be off to
preserve power. We use JS libraries like fabricjs for an interactive canvas where scientists can plan
observation scans, a drag-and-drop interface to combine those scans with calibration markers, and
vis-timeline for charting the whole flyby with fractional second precision.

The app also connects to a separate CakePHP app to pull images generated using IDL, C++, and Python for that flyby.
Additionally, it supports different instrument modes and different models of the same instrument.

Deployed is CakePHP latest CakePHP 4 but soon moving to: 

CakePHP 5.0.9
PHP 8.3.6

JS libraries: 
fabric.js
a lot of custom JavaScript
vis-timeline
jQuery + jQuery UI
jQuery xcalx
Bootstrap 5
Sweetalert2
Plotly
Momentjs
popperjs
d3js
fontawesome
spectrum (colorpicker)
