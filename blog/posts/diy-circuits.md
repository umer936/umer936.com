## Project 2: At Home Circuits

**Type**: Personal  
**Role**: Independent Creator

### **Description**

The "At Home Circuits" project is a personal endeavor that I've been developing over several years. The initial proof of concept is complete, but further refinement and comprehensive documentation are still needed. The project was born out of necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic when access to the UT Austin Makerspace was restricted. I sought to create printed circuit boards (PCBs) from home, as existing options were either unappealing or impractical.

### **Challenges and Exploration**

Traditional methods for creating PCBs at home presented several challenges:

| **Method**       | **Description**                                                                                     | **Negatives**                                                        |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Protoboards**  | Attaching parts to a protoboard or breadboard using jump wires                                    | Unable to be moved easily/used in something else; cannot use surface-mount devices |
| **Othermills**   | Desktop milling machine                                                                             | Expensive; finicky and easy to break bits; mistakes without practice |
| **Voltera**      | Desktop additive PCB drawing machine                                                                 | Expensive; relies on support from a new company; need refills of the "ink" |
| **Etching**      | Using a toner printer to print a negative and etch away the rest using Ferric Chloride             | Requires chemicals; hard to do in small quantities                   |
| **Conductive Pen**| Pen with ink that has conductivity                                                                  | Not very useful; more of a toy or children's education tool         |


Dissatisfied with these options, I explored alternative methods. One intriguing technique involved soldering to aluminum, such as aluminum cans. However, aluminum's tendency to oxidize made soldering difficult. I experimented with various approaches, including using petroleum jelly, vinegar, and specialized fluxes, but results were inconsistent.

### **Innovative Solution**

Leveraging my interest in arts and crafts, I utilized a vinyl cutter (Cricut Maker) to explore new possibilities. Initial attempts to cut aluminum foil were unsuccessful due to its fragility. However, I discovered copper sticker sheets, commonly used to reduce hum in electric guitar coils, which offered a promising alternative.

By covering intricate designs with Scotch tape before cutting, I achieved successful results. The sticker-backed copper allowed for easy transfer of designs to various surfaces, including cardboard, using techniques similar to vinyl application. This method proved to be cost-effective and capable of producing intricate circuits without the need for a fabrication facility.

### **Current Status and Future Goals**

- **Proof of Concept**: Successfully demonstrated the feasibility of creating intricate circuits at home.
- **Materials Used**: Copper sheets, vinyl cutter, soldering equipment, cardboard.
- **Date Created**: July 2021

The next steps involve completing the documentation process and publishing the findings on my website. I aim to explore the limits of this method concerning current, impedance, and other electrical parameters, potentially expanding its applications in DIY electronics.
